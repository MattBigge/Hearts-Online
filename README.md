# Hearts Online
 Lets beat wes

Hearts is a trick-taking game played with a standard 52 card deck. Typically played with 4 players(although 3-5 is possible, it just skews the math and makes for some weird game states on the card spread)

To play Hearts, each player is dealt 13 cards, and the goal is to avoid taking penalty cards (hearts and the Queen of Spades) by playing the highest card of the suit led in each trick; the player with the 2 of Clubs starts the game by leading that card, and players must follow suit if possible; if unable to follow suit, they can play any other card, but should try to avoid playing a heart or the Queen of Spades; the player who takes the least penalty cards at the end of the game wins, with each heart counting as one point and the Queen of Spades counting as 13 points; a special move called "shooting the moon" occurs when a player takes all 13 hearts and the Queen of Spades, allowing them to either subtract 26 points from their score or add 26 points to each opponent's score.
